Description: A package for retreiving and plotting Verifit test results.
    Test results are exported from the Verifit in xml format.  This format is
    useful for storing and sharing non-tabular data, but it is not user-friendly
    for visualization and manipulation.  This package contains functions to
    retreive common Verifit test results (e.g., speech mapping, on-ear
    directionality, etc).  Test results can be returned as a csv file or a
    data frame (for use in R).
